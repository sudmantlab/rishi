Code for selecting new loci for second test using a 1step pcr to reduce risk of contamination

See how many loci from 40 selected SNPs (pickeda at random) we sequenced here

Target amplicons in: `40_singlestep_amplicons.txt`

Calculate counts overlapping using our target amplicons as a regions file
```
bgzip targets156_specific_filtered_MAC0.vcf
bcftools index targets156_specific_filtered_MAC0.vcf.gz
bcftools view -R 40_singlestep_amplicons.txt targets156_specific_filtered_MAC0.vcf.gz > targets156_specific_filtered_MAC0_40ss_amplicons.vcf
bcftools view -H targets156_specific_filtered_MAC0_40ss_amplicons.vcf | wc -l
```
32

Check statistics for the kit we selected (low volume)
```
cp sml_vol_sample_list.txt sml_vol_sample_list_NO6.txt
#remove well6 == negative control
bcftools view -S sml_vol_sample_list_NO6.txt -o targets156_specific_filtered_MAC0_40ss_amplicons_SML_no6.vcf targets156_specific_filtered_MAC0_40ss_amplicons.vcf

vcftools --vcf targets156_specific_filtered_MAC0_40ss_amplicons_SML_no6.vcf --missing-site --out SML_40ss_no6_
```

Now identify high pi SNPs to send to Katie Solari for new loci creation to get 40 high diversity SNPs and confirm the SNPs will not amplify in humans
```

```
And share this file

Now we also want to check the loci we were able to sequence for a follow up panel of 40 SNPs and plot their genotypes

We started by filtering down to the 32 loci we managed to sequence and pulled out those sites from the main vcf into this file:
